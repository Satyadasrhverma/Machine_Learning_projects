# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether it will rain or not using historical weather data. It is built using Python and standard ML libraries in a Jupyter Notebook environment (Google Colab).

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Rainfall Prediction (COLAB).ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## ✅ Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
- User input-based predictions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling)
- Google Colab (for running the notebook)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter.
2. Install required libraries (if not already available):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
